# 02.01 Population density 

# Code related to population ecology 
# A package is needed for point pattern analysis 
install.packages("spatstat")

# letâ€™s use the bei data 
# data description: 
# https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spatstat

# plotting the data

# we'll add additional variables, which are called "auxiliary variables", which explain other variables.

# the extras are gradient and elevation, if we want to select the first element: 
# The quadratic parentheses with 1 indicate the first element of bei.extra

# 02.2 Population distribution

file <- system.file("external/species.shp", package="sdm") 

# external is a folder which has been installed with the package sdm. Inside external there's the "species.shp" file. 

file   # it expressed the path in my computer to the file
# external.shp is a vector file, which deals with points in space with vector coordinates 
rana <- vect(file)   # vect(name) is a function from the terra package 
rana    # you can see the structure of the file 

rana$Occurrence    # It appears a series of 0 which indicates absence of Rana temporaria, and 1 indicates presence. In Ecology these are called "presence-absence data", where you just record the presence of a species, and not the abundance
# The 0 is an uncertain data, because you may have missed the rana, but it could have been there. The 0 could be real or not. Here we'll take the 0 as real absence.

plot(rana)

# we can now select the presences or the absences in the plot. 

# Selecting presences (all the points which indicate 1)

pres <- rana[rana$Occurrence==1,]    # pres = presence
pres$Occurrence
plot(pres, cex=.5)


# == : equal 
# != : unequal 
# , : the comma closes the query 


# Exercise : select absence and call them abse
abse <- rana[rana$Occurrence == 0,]      # You can also write !=1,]
abse$Occurrence
